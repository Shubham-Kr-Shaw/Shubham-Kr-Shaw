<h2 align="center"> Hello there! I am Shubham Kumar Shawüëã </h2>
<h4 align="left"> A seasoned Data Scientist with over three years of adept proficiency in handling data, demonstrating a profound understanding of exploratory data analysis and adeptly addressing missing values. Proficient in the application of machine learning techniques and coding in Python, showcasing expertise in Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Time-series Models, and various Classification Techniques. Possesses a working knowledge of Machine Learning algorithms, including Random Forest, SVM, Boosting, and Bagging techniques, as well as proficiency in Clustering algorithms. Additionally, skilled in Data Visualization utilizing Tableau.

At Gigaforce I am working on intelligent End-to-end automation of the Subrogation Process which is Improving loss ratios in Property and casualty insurance built on decades of claims experience integrated and implemented with state-of-the-art Data science techniques.

As a Data Scientist at Curl Analytics, I have worked on creating a robust submodule capable of accurately identifying NER entities for different document types. Enhanced module performance significantly by optimizing existing code, resulting in ~33% reduction in runtime & ~25% increment in accuracy. Improved the existing pre-processing, data wrangling, and augmentation module. Did several NER-based experiments for Ô¨Ånding the best Ô¨Åt for the entity recognition part of the Product.
Proposed and implemented several new ideas such as using Argilla which is an open-source data curation platform using LLMs and skweak for deÔ¨Åning the labeling functions to automatically label the documents, Using TriggerNER which increased the performance over Traditional NER, etc. I have applied my skills in Python, NumPy, Pandas, ML, and LLM to create and test various models and algorithms for this project.

I have a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Orissa Engineering College, where I learned and applied various analytical techniques, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Time-series Models, Classification Techniques, etc. I also have multiple certifications from Google and MongoDB in Digital Marketing and Data Basics. I am passionate about exploring new possibilities and learning new technologies in the field of Data Science. 

I have also co-founded and directed a company called TECHNOBOOT PVT LTD, where I gained experience in digital marketing, graphic designing, web development, and finance. I am skilled in design, Marketing, Public Speaking, Management, UI/UX and Data Science.
